    - subject: Implement `store` module in helios-util
      hash: 8ce4381e835c6bf77994a654531e5b21a8bd8135
      body: |
        This module provides a simple implementation for a filesystem backed
        store for serializable data. This store will be used to store data
        coming from the backend that doesn't have a counterpart on the local
        state of the system.

        This commit modifies the `config` implementation in helios-util to use
        the filesystem Store.

      hash: a42cf1bf19b2a686b6aff4488ee193795bc5b32c
      body: |
        It achieves this by moving ImageUri to helios_util::types which should
        be the main place for common types.

        It also removes the dependency of legacy and remote crates on mahler by
        just re-exporting mahler::Interrupt from the helios-util crate

      body: |
        The new crate defines `DeviceTarget`, `AppTarget`, etc., as defined by
        the remote backend. Input validations should happen at this crate.

        The types are defined in an new crate to avoid a circular dependency
        between the `helios-remote` and `helios-state` crates.

      body: |
        The planner converts intermediate states to the target type
        while running so this validation will cause planning to fail with
        serialization errors.

        We should do this validation at some point, but it should be through a
        separate type.

        `Regex::new` can be pretty expensive and ImageUri is used a lot.

        The tag was always being stored as `Some("latest")`. This updates the

      body: |
        The RegistryAuthClient was using a RequestConfig conversion that used
        `None` as auth_token, resulting in image pull to fail every time. This
        modifies the `From` implementation to convert from `RemoteConfig` rather
        than `RequestConfig`. This also removes the conversion between
        remote::config::RequestConfig and util::request::RequestConfig that
        could lead to errors due to the name sharing.

        This also removes the arch property, the architecture is a property of
        the device

        type and is used as container metadata and for contracts in the legacy

        supervisor. We'll re-evaluate adding it at that point. This commit also

        removes the `device_type` property from the `Device` type for the same

        reason.

      hash: 3011edff6643f3f1026165375d5b6c739a096c35
      body: |
        This endpoint is a potential footgun that would allow to change the
        whole device state (including hostapps at some point). Is better to
        remove it for now as the `/v3/device/apps` endpoint already allows
        configuring/creating individual apps.

        This provides more visilibity on the logs of when a report was cancelled

        This also skips the initial report and just reports on changes for
        simplicity.

        Refer to what we previously called “fallback” as “legacy” or “legacy
        Supervisor” as appropriate.


        “Fallback” is a good term, in that it describes what the code does (and
        not “what it is”), but “legacy” is more familiar, specific and
        semantically appropriate, as it is not suggesting that this is about
        some general feature Helios provides but is specific to allowing us to
        deploy Helios alongside the legacy Supervisor and is thus ephemeral.

        The old supervisor may be in the middle of an apply when starting the
        service, so we need the service to wait for the supervisor to report
        `applied` before applying the target locally.

        This moves the apply_future poll at the beginning of the tokio select to
        give the future a chance to complete before it gets cancelled by a new
        seek request comming from the API

        The original motivation for this change was to get out of tokio::select

        But breaking it up this way can also help towards ultimately capturing
        the loop’s state machine in a type, which should make it more robust and
        easier to work on.

        A new call to /v1/update or a poll that result in a new target state

        This modifies the Get client in request to store a cache of the

        response body when the response includes an ETag header. The cache
        includes

        both the body and etag and is stored using the endpoint as the

        filename. This prevents a restarting/crashing process to continuously

        poll the API.


        This also updates the core loop to use the cached state if any as the

        first target. This allows the initial target to be applied even if there
        is not

        network connection when the service start (e.g after a boot).

        Replace UpdateRequest struct with enum variants (Poll/Seek) to properly
        separate polling from target seeking operations. Add request queuing to
        handle concurrent target updates and avoid busy waiting on the main
        target apply loop.

      hash: f9d64ad021e440940c2c9c9273a080cf6603166a
      body: |
        The use of `is_poll_pending` was equivalent to busy waiting and keeping
        the CPU spinning at a 100%. This change makes it so the poll interval is
        re-set before and after each poll_future return so the timer will only
        be ignored during the time the target state is applying (will be fixed
        in an new commit).

      body: |
        This allows to remove the need for host networking by listening on
        /tmp/balena-supervisor/helios.sock by default (avoiding the clash with a
        supervisor running on port 48484) and allowing to optionally
        expose the socket to the network via socat (or other mechanism).

      hash: 78f4f73eaf82661053545066bbf6082f760ee287
      body: >
        It was previously tempting to either try to use Get/Patch directly as
        general request helpers, or add unrelated functionality (like we did by
        adding `make_uri` et al) to the request module.


        This moves request as a private submodule of remote, being its sole
        client/user.

      hash: 29c0442b7e29e0ee44e1b5a4cebac63525fa81b7
      body: >
        This basically makes Config completely inert and moves responsibility
        for congiuration to the primary (and currently *only*) entry point — the
        CLI.


        It also streamlines command handling — the CLI only defines the
        necessary arguments and main() dispatches the command using this input.


        It also does a bit of clean up by making some things that shouldn’t be
        exported private and reduces imports.

      body: >
        Moves the update options struct to where it belongs: the target state
        main loop.


        This has the following effects:


        - Fallback now doesn’t have crate dependencies at all (besides
        `request`) which isolates it even more and makes it trivial to delete in
        the future.

        - More importantly, when update options are added or deleted, there’s
        only one place to define them (previously, UpdateRequest had its own set
        of options that were separate, and we transformed back and forth between
        those and UpdateOpts)

        The function is meant to ensure that the next request doesn't happen

        We don't really want to log every time the function is called as that

        API call.

        Using the old mechanism is not robust enough as the supervisor could be

        some platforms.

        to write to the database using JavaScript.

        The library otherwise provides marginal utility (`with_context` looks
        useful), so I’m dropping it completely to remove the temptation to use
        it.

        - Update try_get() method to use local caching fields instead of
        RequestState


        This reduces memory usage for Patch instances and makes the separation

        of concerns clearer between generic request state and GET-specific
        caching.

    - subject: Simplify Patch struct to use blocking interface like Get
      hash: fca0683b882e4304fbaa608d15bf4458bf103a70
      body: |
        Replace background task architecture with synchronous blocking pattern:
        - Remove async background task spawning and channel communication
        - Make patch() method require &mut self and block until completion
        - Use same retry loop pattern as Get struct with try_patch()
        - Remove PatchRequest future type and PatchError::Incomplete variant
        - Update all tests to use new blocking .await pattern
        - Remove batching and request replacement behavior

        This simplifies the API and makes Patch consistent with Get behavior.

        Implement app-specific configuration overrides that read `override.json`
        files from /mnt/temp/apps/{app-uuid}/ and apply them to target state.

        to remote API. Returns 503 with Retry-After: 15 when no target
        state is cached yet.

      hash: 2ac811d6f4f1317b52e2cc9f4d06d9b3aaebd9d9
      body: >
        Implement UplinkService that polls target state from the API and
        notifies

        subscribers of changes. Includes jitter for load balancing, manual fetch

        triggers, and comprehensive error handling.


        - Add rand dependency for jitter calculation

        - Create link module with uplink service implementation

        - Add max_jitter_delay_ms configuration option

        - Integrate uplink service into main application flow

        - Add extensive test coverage for polling, updates, and error scenarios
